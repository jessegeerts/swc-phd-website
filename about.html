<h4>Michael Arbel (Gatsby)</h4>
<div class="authordesc">
Before joining the Gatsby PhD program, I was a computer vision engineer at Chronocam in Paris where I developed Tracking Algorithms 
for event based sensors. Before that, I did a Master in Machine Learning at Ecole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure and my Bachelor at Ecole 
Polytechnique majoring in Applied Mathematics. During my previous research experience, I had the opportunity to explore diverse topics
 ranging form stochastic calculus to deep learning. I hope to continue working on machine learning and exploring its intersections with
 Neuroscience. I also enjoy singing and going to the opera when I have time.

<h4>Jesse Geerts (SWC)</h4>
<div class="authordesc">
Before joining the SWC, I completed a master's in Brain and Mind Sciences at UCL, Universit&eacute; Pierre et Marie Curie and Ecole Normale 
Sup&eacute;rieure, and a degree in Neuroscience at the University of Amsterdam. I am fascinated by the way we represent the outside world in the 
brain, and I hope to learn the experimental and theoretical techniques required to investigate this during my PhD - so far, the SWC seems like
the perfect place. Outside neuroscience, I enjoy music, travelling and discovering what London has to offer.

<h4>Kirsty McNaught (Gatsby)</h4>
<div class="authordesc">
I originally studied Engineering Science at Oxford University, with a focus in biomedical engineering, machine learning and computer vision. I then worked for several years in various startup companies in computer vision fields (stereo imaging, laser mapping and SLAM) before deciding to return to academia to study a PhD at the Gatsby. My research interests lie in the overlap between neuroscience and machine learning. I'm very interested in vision, particularly colour perception and visual attention. Outside of the PhD, I also have a strong interest in assistive technology, and work with the charity SpecialEffect to help disabled users access computer games, particularly using eye-tracking.

<h4>Jorge Menendez (Gatsby)</h4>
<div class="authordesc">
I'm a graduate student at the Gatsby Computational Neursocience Unit 
where I am working on constructing and understanding functional spiking 
networks under biological constraints. I did my undergraduate degree at 
the Johns Hopkins University Department of Cognitive Science, where I 
did a lot of research on visual cognition before falling down the rabbit 
hole of biology and arriving at the belief that neural computation needs 
to be understood at the level of neural circuitry. That's when I came to 
UCL to do an MRes in Computational Biology with <a 
href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/complex/">CoMPLEX</a>. Working jointly with 
Peter Latham and Adam Kampff, my PhD is about trying to formalize 
network architectures that might allow biologically realistic spiking 
neurons to perform useful computations. My hope is that these 
theoretical results may yield predictions we can test in real (rodent) 
brains. When I'm not doing neuroscience, I'm usually thinking about it. 
And I kinda like music too. Check out my research and blog <a 
href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucbpjam/">here</a>.

<h4>Stephen Lenzi (SWC)</h4>
<div class="authordesc">
My background is in calcium imaging and electrophysiology 
in olfactory and visual systems. So far I’ve really enjoyed the opportunity to diversify and 
deepen my knowledge and practical skills and build experimental systems from the ground up, 
which we keep track of in our <a href="blog.html">blog</a>. When I’m not poking brains or coding I like to 
play music and go swimming.

<h4>Matthew Phillips (SWC)</h4>
<div class="authordesc">
I joined the SWC PhD after completing the 4 year MSci Neuroscience program at UCL. Previously I’ve used electrophysiology, 
calcium imaging and behavioural assays to investigate how neural circuit structure and function leads to behaviour. My previous 
labs encouraged the combination of experimental and theoretical work (namely Michael Hausser’s lab at UCL and Nelson Spruston’s 
lab at Janelia Research Campus), and I hope to continue working close to the intersection between experiment and theory in my PhD. 
Outside science, I enjoy getting in twitter fights <a href="https://twitter.com/Phillips_M_G">(@Phillips_M_G)</a>, and play rugby 
and cricket in my spare time.

<h4>Wenkai Xu (Gatsby)</h4>
<div class="authordesc">
Coming from a mathematics and statistics background, I was fascinated by the combination of statistical learning theory with 
the neurodata analysis. Thus I would like to build my knowledge on neuroscience and research on integrating statistical learning 
methods with biological evidence to further understand learning process. My current focus is on applying kernel methods for regression
 and testing problems, which could be extended to improve learning representations. Outside academics, I was a piano player and I 
 enjoy playing golf as well as tennis.
